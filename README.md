# Inventory-Supplier-Management-System-Medical-Store-
This is my first project on GitHub.
Built a user-friendly web-based system to manage medicine inventory, automate stock tracking, and streamline supplier orders. Key features include real-time inventory alerts, invoice generation, supplier database, billing interface, and CSV-based order management. Improved efficiency, reduced manual errors, and enhanced procurement workflows for single-store pharmacy operations.
